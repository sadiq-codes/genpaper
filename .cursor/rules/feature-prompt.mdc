**GOAL:**
The goal is to achieve the question I asked.
---

**CONTEXT:**
Summarize the existing stack, key directories or files, and any relevant features already in place
---

**CONSTRAINTS & RULES:**

1. **Must-Haves** (non-negotiable)

   * ✅ **Complete implementation:** no stubs, no dummy data—use real backend/API endpoints.
   * ✅ **Security & robustness:** validate inputs, handle errors (4xx/5xx), sanitize data.
   * ✅ **No hard-coding:** all keys, URLs, and text must come from config or environment.
   * ✅ **Legacy cleanup:** after adding or modifying functionality, delete related unused code *and* its comments; retain comments in untouched code.
   * ✅ **Respect existing code:** don’t replace well-working libraries or modules with inferior alternatives.

2. **Should-Haves** (high priority)

   * ▶️ **Code quality:** clear, modular structure; new logic belongs in hooks, utils, or components as appropriate.
   * ▶️ **Readability:** well-commented, consistent naming, follow existing style conventions.
   * ▶️ **Performance:** optimize critical paths; aim for fast initial load and interactions.
   * ▶️ **Responsive UX:** design changes must work on desktop and mobile, using dynamic sizing (rem, %, flex).

3. **Nice-to-Haves** (if time and tokens allow)

   * ✨ **Unit tests:** cover new logic and edge cases.
   * ✨ **Documentation:** update `README.md` or API docs if new endpoints/functions are exposed.
   * ✨ **Minimal dependencies:** avoid adding new libraries unless absolutely necessary—prefer well-maintained, documented packages.
