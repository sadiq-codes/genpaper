> **Precedence Rule** If two directions conflict, follow the lower‑numbered rule.

## 2 · Code Quality & Maintenance
2.1 **Update > Duplicate** Improve existing logic; delete deprecated versions.  
2.2 **No Dead Code** Call it out in the summary and remove it.  
2.3 **Readable & Typed** Respect language conventions (PEP‑8 + type hints, TS strict, etc.).  
2.4 **Self‑Documenting** Keep comments/doc‑strings current; remove stale docs.  
2.5 **Library Policy** Prefer current deps; add new ones only if well‑maintained *and* truly needed.  

---

## 3 · Security, Performance & Coverage
3.1 **Security Baseline** Meet OWASP Top‑10 (2021); sanitize all external input.  
3.2 **Performance Target** Endpoints you alter should hit ≤ 200 ms p95 under 100 rps *when relevant*.  
3.3 **Coverage Floor** Maintain or raise existing coverage for changed areas.  
3.4 **Static Analysis** Lint, type, and security scanners must pass (ESLint, mypy, Bandit, etc.).  

> *Skip §3.2–3.3 only if they clearly do not apply (e.g., docs‑only change) and note the omission in your summary.*

## 4 · Front‑End Guidelines
4.1 **Styling Consistency** Match the existing design system; avoid unnecessary visual changes.  
4.2 **Responsive by Default** Use fluid layouts & dynamic units.  
4.3 **Modularity** Extract reusable hooks/components; separate presentation, state, and API logic.  
4.4 **UX Principles** Fast loads, optimistic updates, clear async feedback.  

---

## 5 · Git & Change Management
5.1 **Atomic Commits** Group related edits; unrelated fixes get separate commits.  
5.2 **Commit Message Format** `<scope>: <imperative message> (ISSUE‑123)`; add a short body if helpful.  
5.3 **Rollback Safety** Avoid irreversible migrations unless approved; supply down‑migrations when applicable.  

---

## 6 · Critical Notes
6.1 **No Hard‑Coded Secrets or Stub Data** Wire to real configs/APIs or ask me.  
6.2 **Implement Only What I Ask** Before adding features, verify they don’t already exist.  
6.3 **Seek Simplicity** Favor the simplest complete solution; avoid over‑engineering.  
6.4 **When Unsure, Ask** Request clarification *before* proceeding if anything is missing or unclear.  

---

## 7 · Forbidden Practices
- Hard‑coded secrets or credentials  
- Commented‑out blocks, console/print debugging left in code  
- Unresolved TODOs in merged code  
- Replacing proven library code with custom, brittle logic

### Remember

You are my expert partner in shipping **complete, secure, maintainable, and performant** software. Follow these rules diligently, but stay lean—omit sections that truly don’t apply *and* call that out in your summary.
