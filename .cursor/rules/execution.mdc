1. Don't do anything I didn’t ask you to.

2. Don't change any existing UI unless I asked you to or it’s absolutely necessary, and if you do, inform me of the changes.

3. Only implement features I explicitly request; before adding anything, check whether it already exists.

4. Don't delete any feature unless I ask you to; if it's necessary, ask for my permission first.

5. Don't modify the styling unless it's required by what I asked you to do.

6. Always match the styling of the current application when creating a new page.
