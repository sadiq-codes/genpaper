# Literature Review Context

This paper SYNTHESIZES existing research - it does NOT involve original data collection.

## Critical Distinctions

### What "Methodology" Means for Literature Reviews

"Methodology" for a literature review means the **LITERATURE SEARCH methodology**:
- Which databases were searched (e.g., Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed)
- What keywords and search strings were used
- What date range was covered
- What inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied
- How many papers were screened and selected

"Methodology" does **NOT** mean empirical research methodology:
- NO descriptions of data collection procedures
- NO descriptions of surveys, interviews, or experiments conducted
- NO sample sizes or participant recruitment
- NO statistical analysis of original data

### Section Guidelines

- A literature review should NOT have a "Results" section presenting original findings
- Instead, use sections like "Findings", "Thematic Analysis", or "Synthesis"
- The paper should emphasize: synthesis across sources, critical analysis, gap identification
- Source diversity and comprehensiveness are CRUCIAL for literature reviews
- The reader should gain a comprehensive understanding of the state of knowledge

## Organizational Approaches

The literature review should be organized using ONE of these approaches (or a combination):

### 1. THEMATIC
Organize by recurring themes or concepts.

**Best when:** The topic has multiple distinct aspects or sub-areas

**Example:** "Barriers to healthcare" → policy barriers, economic barriers, cultural barriers, geographic barriers

### 2. CHRONOLOGICAL
Trace the development of ideas over time.

**Best when:** The topic has evolved significantly, showing how understanding changed

**Example:** "Distance learning" → correspondence courses → video lectures → MOOCs → AI tutors

### 3. METHODOLOGICAL
Compare findings from different research approaches.

**Best when:** Different methods yield different insights or conflicting results

**Example:** "Employee motivation" → survey studies vs. experimental studies vs. qualitative interviews

### 4. THEORETICAL
Organize by competing theories or frameworks.

**Best when:** Multiple theoretical perspectives explain the phenomenon

**Example:** "Organizational change" → planned change theory vs. emergent change vs. complexity theory

Choose the approach that best illuminates the topic. For complex topics, COMBINE approaches (e.g., thematic overall with chronological development within each theme).

## Pivotal Publications

Identify and highlight LANDMARK STUDIES that shaped the field:
- Foundational works that established key concepts or frameworks
- Studies that challenged prevailing assumptions and redirected research
- Methodological innovations that changed how the topic is studied
- Highly influential works that many subsequent studies cite or build upon

When discussing landmark studies, explain their **INFLUENCE**:

> "Bandura's (1977) social learning theory was pivotal because it expanded behavioral explanations to include cognitive and social factors, fundamentally changing how researchers approached skill acquisition and spawning decades of self-efficacy research."

## Literature Review Structure

The review must have clear Introduction, Body, and Conclusion:

### INTRODUCTION should:
- Establish the focus, scope, and purpose of the review
- Define key terms and boundaries (what's included/excluded)
- State the research question or gap being addressed
- Preview the organizational approach you're using

### BODY should:
- Follow your chosen organizational approach (thematic, chronological, etc.)
- Use clear subheadings for each major section
- Synthesize sources WITHIN each section (don't just list studies)
- Show connections and transitions BETWEEN sections
- Identify contradictions, debates, and patterns

### CONCLUSION should:
- Summarize the key findings from the reviewed literature
- Emphasize the significance of these findings
- Clearly state the gap in knowledge that remains
- Explain how future research (or your research) addresses this gap

## Critical Analysis Requirements

A literature review MUST include critical analysis, not just summaries. The profile's qualityCriteria MUST include:

1. "Identification of contradictions and debates between sources"
2. "Critical evaluation of methodological strengths and limitations"
3. "Synthesis showing patterns across multiple studies"
4. "Discussion of unresolved tensions in the literature"
5. "Identification of pivotal/landmark publications and their influence"

## When to Cite in Literature Reviews

Since a literature review synthesizes existing research, MOST claims require citations:

**ALWAYS cite:**
- Statistics, findings, theories, methods, opinions from other authors
- Specific claims, definitions, frameworks from the literature
- When comparing or contrasting what different authors found

**NO citation needed:**
- Your own synthesis, analysis, or conclusions drawn from cited work
- Widely accepted common knowledge in the field

In literature reviews, most paragraphs should contain multiple citations because you are reporting what the literature says. Only your analytical observations connecting sources do not require citations.

## Evidence Integrity Warning

**CRITICAL: ONLY CITE WHAT IS IN THE PROVIDED SOURCES**

- Include statistics, sample sizes, and specific findings ONLY if they appear in the evidence
- If a source doesn't provide specific numbers, describe the findings qualitatively
- NEVER fabricate statistics, percentages, or specific claims not in the sources
- It is better to write "Smith (2020) found a positive relationship" than to invent "r=0.45"
- Different disciplines have different norms: qualitative research may not have statistics
