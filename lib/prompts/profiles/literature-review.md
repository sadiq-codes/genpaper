# Literature Review Context

This paper SYNTHESIZES existing research - it does NOT involve original data collection.

## Critical Distinctions

### What "Methodology" Means for Literature Reviews

"Methodology" for a literature review means the **LITERATURE SEARCH methodology**:
- Which databases were searched (e.g., Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed)
- What keywords and search strings were used
- What date range was covered
- What inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied
- How many papers were screened and selected

"Methodology" does **NOT** mean empirical research methodology:
- NO descriptions of data collection procedures
- NO descriptions of surveys, interviews, or experiments conducted
- NO sample sizes or participant recruitment
- NO statistical analysis of original data

### Section Guidelines

- A literature review should NOT have a "Results" section presenting original findings
- Instead, use sections like "Findings", "Thematic Analysis", or "Synthesis"
- The paper should emphasize: synthesis across sources, critical analysis, gap identification
- Source diversity and comprehensiveness are CRUCIAL for literature reviews
- The reader should gain a comprehensive understanding of the state of knowledge

## Organizational Approaches

The literature review should be organized using ONE of these approaches (or a combination):

### 1. THEMATIC
Organize by recurring themes or concepts.

**Best when:** The topic has multiple distinct aspects or sub-areas

**Example:** "Barriers to healthcare" → policy barriers, economic barriers, cultural barriers, geographic barriers

### 2. CHRONOLOGICAL
Trace the development of ideas over time.

**Best when:** The topic has evolved significantly, showing how understanding changed

**Example:** "Distance learning" → correspondence courses → video lectures → MOOCs → AI tutors

### 3. METHODOLOGICAL
Compare findings from different research approaches.

**Best when:** Different methods yield different insights or conflicting results

**Example:** "Employee motivation" → survey studies vs. experimental studies vs. qualitative interviews

### 4. THEORETICAL
Organize by competing theories or frameworks.

**Best when:** Multiple theoretical perspectives explain the phenomenon

**Example:** "Organizational change" → planned change theory vs. emergent change vs. complexity theory

Choose the approach that best illuminates the topic. For complex topics, COMBINE approaches (e.g., thematic overall with chronological development within each theme).

## Pivotal Publications

Identify and highlight LANDMARK STUDIES that shaped the field:
- Foundational works that established key concepts or frameworks
- Studies that challenged prevailing assumptions and redirected research
- Methodological innovations that changed how the topic is studied
- Highly influential works that many subsequent studies cite or build upon

When discussing landmark studies, explain their **INFLUENCE**:

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLE BELOW - DO NOT COPY CONTENT, ONLY STRUCTURE:
> "[Author from YOUR evidence]'s [theory/finding] was pivotal because it [impact from YOUR evidence], 
> fundamentally changing how researchers approached [topic] and spawning [subsequent developments]."

⚠️ Replace ALL bracketed content with ACTUAL information from your evidence snippets.
If your evidence doesn't identify a study as "pivotal," don't claim it is.

## Literature Review Structure

The review must have clear Introduction, Body, and Conclusion:

### INTRODUCTION should:
- Establish the focus, scope, and purpose of the review
- Define key terms and boundaries (what's included/excluded)
- State the research question or gap being addressed
- Preview the organizational approach you're using

### BODY should:
- Follow your chosen organizational approach (thematic, chronological, etc.)
- Use clear subheadings for each major section
- Synthesize sources WITHIN each section (don't just list studies)
- Show connections and transitions BETWEEN sections
- Identify contradictions, debates, and patterns

### CONCLUSION should:
- Summarize the key findings from the reviewed literature
- Emphasize the significance of these findings
- Clearly state the gap in knowledge that remains
- Explain how future research (or your research) addresses this gap

## Critical Analysis Requirements

A literature review MUST include critical analysis, not just summaries. The profile's qualityCriteria MUST include:

1. "Identification of contradictions and debates between sources"
2. "Critical evaluation of methodological strengths and limitations"
3. "Synthesis showing patterns across multiple studies"
4. "Discussion of unresolved tensions in the literature"
5. "Identification of pivotal/landmark publications and their influence"

### Critical Evaluation Framework

For EACH major finding or claim discussed, evaluate:

**Methodological Quality:**
- Sample size adequacy (n=? - is it sufficient?)
- Study design appropriateness (experimental, observational, qualitative?)
- Potential biases or confounds
- Measurement validity and reliability

**Generalizability:**
- Context limitations (geographic, temporal, demographic)
- Population constraints (who was studied?)
- Replication status (have findings been confirmed?)
- External validity concerns

**Contradictions:**
- Studies with conflicting findings
- Possible explanations for discrepancies (methods, samples, contexts)
- Unresolved debates in the field

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLE BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:

**EXAMPLE (Good Critical Evaluation) - STRUCTURE ONLY:**
> "While [Author from YOUR evidence] demonstrated [metric from YOUR evidence] for [topic], 
> this study used only [limitation from YOUR evidence] (n=[sample size IF in evidence]). 
> [Other context from YOUR evidence] remains limited, with [other studies from YOUR evidence] 
> reporting [different findings from YOUR evidence], likely due to [explanation]. 
> Furthermore, [limitation you identify from YOUR evidence] may limit applicability 
> in [context]—a limitation [noted in YOUR evidence or you identify]."

⚠️ CRITICAL: Only include percentages, sample sizes, and specific statistics that 
ACTUALLY APPEAR in your evidence snippets. If evidence lacks numbers, write qualitatively:
- "demonstrated high sensitivity" instead of inventing "95%"
- "a small sample" instead of inventing "n=50"

### Synthesis Patterns to Demonstrate

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:

❌ **AVOID (Descriptive listing):**
> "[Author A] found X. [Author B] found Y. [Author C] found Z."

✅ **USE (Integrated synthesis) - STRUCTURE ONLY:**
> "A consistent pattern emerges across recent studies: researchers examining [topic from YOUR evidence] 
> have consistently found [finding from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id1] [CITE: your-actual-id2] [CITE: your-actual-id3]. 
> However, findings diverge sharply regarding [aspect from YOUR evidence], with [some studies from YOUR evidence] suggesting 
> [one finding] [CITE: your-actual-id4] while [other studies from YOUR evidence] reveal [different finding] [CITE: your-actual-id5]. 
> This [type of divide you identify] may explain the apparent contradiction, as..."

⚠️ Replace ALL bracketed content with ACTUAL information from your evidence snippets.

### Quantitative Synthesis

When multiple studies report comparable metrics:

| Pattern | How to Synthesize |
|---------|-------------------|
| 3+ studies, same metric | Report range: "[metric] ranged from [low] to [high] across studies" (USE ACTUAL NUMBERS FROM EVIDENCE) |
| Consistent direction | Note convergence: "all [N] studies found [direction] effects" (COUNT YOUR ACTUAL SOURCES) |
| Mixed findings | Quantify disagreement: "[X] of [Y] studies found significant effects" (COUNT YOUR ACTUAL SOURCES) |
| No numbers available | Use qualitative terms: "consistently," "predominantly," "mixed" |

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Never fabricate statistics. 
- If numbers ARE in evidence: use exact numbers from evidence
- If numbers are NOT in evidence: use qualitative terms like "consistently higher," "most studies found," etc.
- COUNT your actual sources - don't invent "5 studies" if you only have 3

## When to Cite in Literature Reviews

Since a literature review synthesizes existing research, MOST claims require citations:

**ALWAYS cite:**
- Statistics, findings, theories, methods, opinions from other authors
- Specific claims, definitions, frameworks from the literature
- When comparing or contrasting what different authors found

**NO citation needed:**
- Your own synthesis, analysis, or conclusions drawn from cited work
- Widely accepted common knowledge in the field

In literature reviews, most paragraphs should contain multiple citations because you are reporting what the literature says. Only your analytical observations connecting sources do not require citations.

## Table Requirements for Literature Reviews

When synthesizing multiple studies, USE TABLES to organize complex information:

### Required Tables (include at least ONE):

⚠️ TABLE EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:
Populate tables ONLY with data from YOUR evidence snippets.

**Table 1: Summary of Reviewed Studies**
| Author (Year) | Sample/Context | Method | Key Findings |
|---------------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| [Author from evidence] [CITE: actual-id] | [Sample IF in evidence, else "not reported"] | [Method from evidence] | [Finding from evidence] |
| [Author from evidence] [CITE: actual-id] | [Sample IF in evidence, else "not reported"] | [Method from evidence] | [Finding from evidence] |

**Table 2: Comparison of Approaches/Methods**
| Approach | Advantages | Limitations | Supporting Studies |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Method from evidence] | [Advantage from evidence] | [Limitation from evidence] | [CITE: actual-id1] [CITE: actual-id2] |

**Table 3: Contradictory Findings**
| Finding | Studies Supporting | Studies Contradicting | Possible Explanation |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| [Finding from evidence] | [CITE: actual-ids] | [CITE: actual-ids] | [Your analysis] |

⚠️ CRITICAL: If your evidence doesn't include sample sizes, methods, or other details, 
either omit that column OR write "not reported" - NEVER invent data.

### Table Guidelines:
- Include citation markers in the Author or Studies column
- Keep cell content concise (key points only)
- Add a brief paragraph interpreting the table below it
- Use tables to COMPLEMENT prose, not replace synthesis
- Tables are especially valuable when comparing 4+ studies

## Source Diversity Requirements

**Literature reviews MUST demonstrate comprehensive coverage:**

- Aim to cite **70-100%** of available papers across the review
- Each thematic section should draw from **multiple different sources**
- Avoid over-reliance on any single source (no paper cited 5+ times unless foundational)
- Prioritize breadth: 15 papers cited once each > 3 papers cited 5 times each

**Source Distribution Check:**
Before finalizing each section, verify:
- [ ] Have I used sources from across my evidence pool?
- [ ] Am I citing different sources for different aspects?
- [ ] Have I avoided citing the same source in consecutive sentences?

## Evidence Integrity Warning

**CRITICAL: ONLY CITE WHAT IS IN THE PROVIDED SOURCES**

- Include statistics, sample sizes, and specific findings ONLY if they appear in the evidence
- If a source doesn't provide specific numbers, describe the findings qualitatively
- NEVER fabricate statistics, percentages, or specific claims not in the sources
- It is better to write "Smith (2020) found a positive relationship" than to invent "r=0.45"
- Different disciplines have different norms: qualitative research may not have statistics
