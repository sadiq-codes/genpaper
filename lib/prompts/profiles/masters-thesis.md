# Master's Thesis Context

A master's thesis demonstrates mastery of research methods and makes a meaningful contribution to the field.

## Structure Expectations

### 1. Introduction (Funnel Structure)
- Start broad: general topic and its importance
- Narrow down: specific area of investigation
- State: research problem, purpose, questions/hypotheses
- Preview: significance and scope of study

### 2. Literature Review (Critical Analysis Required)
- Synthesize existing research, don't just summarize
- Identify debates, contradictions, and gaps
- Justify how YOUR study addresses the gap
- End with clear statement of what remains unknown

**Organizational Approach - Choose based on your topic:**
- **THEMATIC:** Organize by themes (best for multi-faceted topics)
- **CHRONOLOGICAL:** Trace development over time (best for evolving topics)
- **METHODOLOGICAL:** Compare research approaches (best for method-diverse topics)
- **THEORETICAL:** Organize by competing theories (best for theory-rich topics)

**Pivotal Publications:** Identify landmark studies that shaped the field and explain WHY they were influential (not just what they found).

### 3. Methodology (Replicable Detail)
- Research design with justification
- Population and sampling (who, how many, how selected)
- Instruments with validity and reliability evidence
- Data collection procedures
- Analysis methods with justification

### 4. Results (Systematic Presentation)
- Present findings without interpretation
- Use tables and figures appropriately
- Organize by research questions/hypotheses
- Include summary of key findings

### 5. Discussion (Three-Part Structure for Each Finding)
- **STATE:** What did you find?
- **COMPARE:** How does it align/contrast with prior research?
- **EXPLAIN:** Why might your results agree or differ?

### 6. Conclusion
- Implications (theoretical and practical)
- Limitations acknowledged honestly
- Recommendations for future research

## Citing Empirical Studies in Literature Review

When reviewing prior research, include context about methodology:

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:

**Weak:** "[Author] found [topic] affects [outcome]."

**Strong:** "[Author from YOUR evidence] [method from YOUR evidence] and found [finding from YOUR evidence] 
(β = [value IF in evidence], p [value IF in evidence]), though [limitation from YOUR evidence or you identify]."

⚠️ CRITICAL: Only include statistics (β, p-values, sample sizes) that ACTUALLY APPEAR in your evidence.
If numbers aren't available, write qualitatively: "found a significant relationship" instead of inventing "β = 0.42".

## Gap Identification

**GAP IDENTIFICATION IS MANDATORY:**

Your literature review must explicitly state what gap exists and how your study addresses it.

## Synthesis Requirements (Critical for Master's Level)

Master's theses demand SYNTHESIS, not just summary. You must demonstrate analytical thinking.

### Synthesis Patterns

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:

❌ **AVOID (Descriptive - Undergraduate Level):**
> "[Author A] found X. [Author B] found Y. [Author C] found Z."

✅ **USE (Synthetic - Master's Level) - STRUCTURE ONLY:**
> "A convergent pattern emerges from [type of research from YOUR evidence]: [description of studies from YOUR evidence] 
> consistently link [topic] to [outcome] [CITE: your-actual-id1] [CITE: your-actual-id2] [CITE: your-actual-id3]. However, 
> [other type of research from YOUR evidence] reveal a more nuanced picture, with [factors from YOUR evidence] 
> moderating this relationship [CITE: your-actual-id4] [CITE: your-actual-id5]. This [type of divide you identify] 
> suggests that [your synthesis/interpretation]."

⚠️ Replace ALL bracketed content with ACTUAL information from your evidence.
Do not invent sample sizes (like "N > 500") unless they appear in your evidence.

### Critical Evaluation Framework

For EVERY major claim or finding you discuss, evaluate:

| Dimension | Questions to Address |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Methodological Quality** | Sample size? Design appropriate? Biases controlled? |
| **Generalizability** | Context-specific or broadly applicable? Replicated? |
| **Contradictions** | Other studies disagree? Why might findings differ? |
| **Gaps** | What remains untested? What would strengthen evidence? |

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLE BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:

### Example (Good Critical Evaluation) - STRUCTURE ONLY:
> "While [evidence type from YOUR sources] suggests [finding from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id], 
> [limitation you identify] limits confidence. Specifically, 
> [pattern you observe in YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id]. This [gap/artifact you identify] has not been 
> adequately addressed in subsequent research, representing a significant methodological 
> gap that this thesis aims to address through [your approach]."

⚠️ CRITICAL: Only include effect sizes (d = X.XX) if they ACTUALLY APPEAR in your evidence.
If numbers aren't available, write: "suggests a moderate effect" instead of inventing "d = 0.45".

## Table Requirements for Master's Theses

### Required Tables:

⚠️ TABLE FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES ⚠️
Populate tables ONLY with data from YOUR evidence snippets.

**Table 1: Summary of Key Studies** (in Literature Review)
| Author (Year) | Sample | Design | Key Finding | Limitation |
|---------------|--------|--------|-------------|------------|
| [Author from evidence] [CITE: actual-id] | [Sample IF in evidence] | [Design from evidence] | [Finding from evidence] | [Limitation from evidence] |

**Table 2: Comparison of Theoretical Frameworks** (if applicable)
| Theory | Key Propositions | Supporting Evidence | Critiques |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| [Theory from evidence] | [Propositions from evidence] | [CITE: actual-ids] | [Critiques from evidence] |

**Table 3: Methodological Comparison** (if discussing methods)
| Method | Strengths | Weaknesses | Studies Using |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| [Method from evidence] | [Strengths from evidence] | [Weaknesses from evidence] | [CITE: actual-ids] |

⚠️ CRITICAL: If your evidence doesn't include sample sizes, designs, or limitations, 
either omit that column OR write "not reported" - NEVER invent data.

### Results Tables (Required):
- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation matrix (if quantitative)
- Main analysis results with confidence intervals
- Hypothesis support summary

## Source Diversity Requirements

**Master's theses require COMPREHENSIVE literature coverage:**

- Literature Review section: cite **70-100%** of available relevant sources
- Each major theme should draw from **at least 4-5 different sources**
- Avoid citing any single source more than 3-4 times
- Include both foundational/seminal works AND recent studies

**Source Distribution Check:**
- [ ] Have I covered classic/foundational works in the field?
- [ ] Have I included recent research (last 5 years)?
- [ ] Am I citing different sources for different claims?
- [ ] Have I represented different methodological approaches?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged contradictory findings?

---

## Quantitative Synthesis

When multiple studies report comparable findings, aggregate when possible:

| Situation | How to Synthesize |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Same metric, 3+ studies | "Effect sizes ranged from d = 0.3 to d = 0.6" |
| Consistent direction | "All seven studies found positive effects" |
| Mixed findings | "Results were mixed, with 4 of 9 studies finding significance" |
| Meta-analyses exist | "Meta-analytic evidence suggests d = 0.45 [CITE]" |

**CRITICAL:** Never fabricate statistics. If specific numbers aren't available in evidence, use qualitative descriptors.
