# Master's Thesis Context

A master's thesis demonstrates mastery of research methods and makes a meaningful contribution to the field.

## Structure Expectations

### 1. Introduction (Funnel Structure)
- Start broad: general topic and its importance
- Narrow down: specific area of investigation
- State: research problem, purpose, questions/hypotheses
- Preview: significance and scope of study

### 2. Literature Review (Critical Analysis Required)
- Synthesize existing research, don't just summarize
- Identify debates, contradictions, and gaps
- Justify how YOUR study addresses the gap
- End with clear statement of what remains unknown

**Organizational Approach - Choose based on your topic:**
- **THEMATIC:** Organize by themes (best for multi-faceted topics)
- **CHRONOLOGICAL:** Trace development over time (best for evolving topics)
- **METHODOLOGICAL:** Compare research approaches (best for method-diverse topics)
- **THEORETICAL:** Organize by competing theories (best for theory-rich topics)

**Pivotal Publications:** Identify landmark studies that shaped the field and explain WHY they were influential (not just what they found).

### 3. Methodology (Replicable Detail)
- Research design with justification
- Population and sampling (who, how many, how selected)
- Instruments with validity and reliability evidence
- Data collection procedures
- Analysis methods with justification

### 4. Results (Systematic Presentation)
- Present findings without interpretation
- Use tables and figures appropriately
- Organize by research questions/hypotheses
- Include summary of key findings

### 5. Discussion (Three-Part Structure for Each Finding)
- **STATE:** What did you find?
- **COMPARE:** How does it align/contrast with prior research?
- **EXPLAIN:** Why might your results agree or differ?

### 6. Conclusion
- Implications (theoretical and practical)
- Limitations acknowledged honestly
- Recommendations for future research

## Citing Empirical Studies in Literature Review

When reviewing prior research, include context about methodology:

**Weak:** "Smith (2020) found motivation affects performance."

**Strong:** "Smith (2020) surveyed 250 undergraduates and found intrinsic motivation significantly predicted GPA (β = 0.42, p < .001), though the cross-sectional design limits causal inference."

## Gap Identification

**GAP IDENTIFICATION IS MANDATORY:**

Your literature review must explicitly state what gap exists and how your study addresses it.
