# Research Article Context

A research article presents **ORIGINAL EMPIRICAL RESEARCH** - NOT a literature review.

---

## CRITICAL: THIS IS EMPIRICAL RESEARCH - NOT A LITERATURE REVIEW

---

## Mandatory Sections for Research Articles

1. **Introduction** - Research problem, significance, and specific research questions/hypotheses
2. **Literature Review** - Brief review to establish theoretical framework (NOT the main content)
3. **Methodology** - EMPIRICAL research design:
   - Sample/participants description (who, how many, how selected)
   - Variables (independent, dependent, control)
   - Data collection methods (surveys, experiments, observations, datasets used)
   - Analytical methods (regression, ANOVA, qualitative coding, etc.)
   - Validity and reliability measures
4. **Results** - YOUR ORIGINAL FINDINGS:
   - Descriptive statistics (means, SDs, frequencies)
   - Inferential statistics with p-values, confidence intervals
   - Tables and figures presenting YOUR data
   - Hypothesis testing outcomes (supported/not supported)
5. **Discussion** - Interpretation of YOUR results in context of existing literature
6. **Limitations** - Honest assessment of study constraints
7. **Conclusion** - Summary of YOUR contributions and implications

## Forbidden for Research Articles

- "Thematic Analysis" as a main section (that's for lit reviews)
- Reporting what OTHER studies found as your main content
- Literature search methodology (that's for systematic reviews)
- Sections that only summarize existing work without original data

## Handling Research Data in Research Articles

Research articles present ORIGINAL findings. How data is handled depends on context:

### Scenario A: User provides their own research data
If the user has provided their own methodology, results, or data:
- Use THEIR actual data and findings
- Do NOT fabricate or replace their numbers
- Format their data properly with statistics

### Scenario B: Template/Example paper (no user data provided)
If this is a demonstration of research article format WITHOUT real data:
- Generate ILLUSTRATIVE data that demonstrates proper format
- Make numbers realistic and internally consistent
- CLEARLY STATE in Limitations: "This paper presents illustrative data to demonstrate research article structure. Actual research would require primary data collection."

### Scenario C: Literature-based research article
If the research uses secondary data from cited sources:
- Only include statistics that appear in the cited sources
- Do NOT fabricate numbers not in the evidence
- Clearly attribute all data to sources

## Required Format for Results (when data is available)

### Descriptive Statistics Table:
| Variable | N | Mean | SD | Min | Max |
|----------|---|------|-----|-----|-----|
| Variable 1 | 247 | 3.45 | 1.12 | 1 | 5 |

### Analysis Results Table:
| Predictor | β | SE | t | p | 95% CI |
|-----------|-----|------|------|-------|--------------|
| Predictor 1 | 0.34 | 0.08 | 4.25 | <.001 | [0.18, 0.50] |

### Hypothesis testing format:
- "H1 was supported: X significantly predicted Y (β = 0.34, p < .001)"
- "H2 was not supported: no significant relationship (β = -0.12, p = .184)"

**KEY PRINCIPLE:** Be specific when data is available, but NEVER fabricate data and claim it's real research. Transparency about data sources is essential.

## When to Cite in Research Articles (Section-Specific)

### Introduction
Cite when establishing the research problem, prior work, and theoretical background.
- **Cite:** statistics showing the importance of the problem
- **Cite:** prior findings that motivate your research question
- **Cite:** theories or frameworks you're building on

### Literature Review
Cite extensively - you're reporting what others found.
- **Cite:** every finding, theory, or method you discuss from another author
- **No citation:** your synthesis or identification of gaps

### Methodology
Cite sparingly - only for established methods.
- **Cite:** validated instruments, scales, or procedures from published sources
- **Cite:** methodological frameworks you're following
- **No citation:** descriptions of YOUR specific procedures

### Results
MINIMAL TO NO CITATIONS - these are YOUR findings.
- **No citation:** your data, statistics, tables, and findings
- **Rare citation:** only if directly comparing your result to a specific prior finding

### Discussion
Moderate citations - interpreting YOUR results in context.
- **Cite:** when comparing your findings to prior work
- **Cite:** theories that help explain your results
- **No citation:** your interpretations, implications, and conclusions

### Limitations/Conclusion
Minimal citations.
- **Cite:** only if referencing specific methodological literature
- **No citation:** your own assessment of limitations and contributions

## Language Guidelines

### Appropriate Language:
- "Our findings indicate..." / "The results show..."
- "We found that X was significantly related to Y (β = 0.45, p < 0.01)"
- "Hypothesis 1 was supported: entrepreneurs with prior experience..."
- "Our data suggest..."

### Inappropriate Language (Literature Review Style):
- "Studies have shown..." / "Research indicates..."
- "According to Smith (2020)..."
- "The literature suggests..."
- "Scholars have found..."

## Quality Criteria Requirements

The profile's qualityCriteria MUST include:
1. "Clear hypothesis or research question formulation"
2. "Rigorous empirical methodology with defined sample and variables"
3. "Original data presentation with statistical evidence including tables"
4. "Specific statistical results (β coefficients, p-values, confidence intervals)"
5. "Interpretation of findings in theoretical context"
