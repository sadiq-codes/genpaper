# Research Article Context

A research article presents **ORIGINAL EMPIRICAL RESEARCH** - NOT a literature review.

---

## CRITICAL: THIS IS EMPIRICAL RESEARCH - NOT A LITERATURE REVIEW

---

## Mandatory Sections for Research Articles

1. **Introduction** - Research problem, significance, and specific research questions/hypotheses
2. **Literature Review** - Brief review to establish theoretical framework (NOT the main content)
3. **Methodology** - EMPIRICAL research design:
   - Sample/participants description (who, how many, how selected)
   - Variables (independent, dependent, control)
   - Data collection methods (surveys, experiments, observations, datasets used)
   - Analytical methods (regression, ANOVA, qualitative coding, etc.)
   - Validity and reliability measures
4. **Results** - YOUR ORIGINAL FINDINGS:
   - Descriptive statistics (means, SDs, frequencies)
   - Inferential statistics with p-values, confidence intervals
   - Tables and figures presenting YOUR data
   - Hypothesis testing outcomes (supported/not supported)
5. **Discussion** - Interpretation of YOUR results in context of existing literature
6. **Limitations** - Honest assessment of study constraints
7. **Conclusion** - Summary of YOUR contributions and implications

## Forbidden for Research Articles

- "Thematic Analysis" as a main section (that's for lit reviews)
- Reporting what OTHER studies found as your main content
- Literature search methodology (that's for systematic reviews)
- Sections that only summarize existing work without original data

---

## Handling Research Data in Research Articles

Research articles present ORIGINAL findings. How data is handled depends on context:

### Scenario A: User provides their own research data
If the user has provided their own methodology, results, or data:
- Use THEIR actual data and findings
- Do NOT fabricate or replace their numbers
- Format their data properly with statistics

### Scenario B: Template/Example paper (no user data provided)
If this is a demonstration of research article format WITHOUT real data:
- Generate ILLUSTRATIVE data that demonstrates proper format
- Make numbers realistic and internally consistent
- CLEARLY STATE in Limitations: "This paper presents illustrative data to demonstrate research article structure. Actual research would require primary data collection."

### Scenario C: Literature-based research article
If the research uses secondary data from cited sources:
- Only include statistics that appear in the cited sources
- Do NOT fabricate numbers not in the evidence
- Clearly attribute all data to sources

## Required Format for Results (when data is available)

⚠️ TABLE FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES ⚠️
These show STRUCTURE only. Use YOUR actual data or data from YOUR evidence.

### Descriptive Statistics Table:
| Variable | N | Mean | SD | Min | Max |
|----------|---|------|-----|-----|-----|
| [Your variable] | [Your N] | [Your mean] | [Your SD] | [Your min] | [Your max] |

### Analysis Results Table:
| Predictor | β | SE | t | p | 95% CI |
|-----------|-----|------|------|-------|--------------|
| [Your predictor] | [Your β] | [Your SE] | [Your t] | [Your p] | [Your CI] |

### Hypothesis testing format:
- "H1 was supported: [Your finding] (β = [Your value], p [Your p-value])"
- "H2 was not supported: [Your finding] (β = [Your value], p = [Your p-value])"

⚠️ **KEY PRINCIPLE:** 
- If YOU have original research data: use YOUR actual numbers
- If this is a template/example paper: clearly state data is illustrative
- If using secondary data: ONLY include statistics from YOUR evidence sources
- NEVER fabricate data and claim it's real research

## When to Cite in Research Articles (Section-Specific)

### Introduction
Cite when establishing the research problem, prior work, and theoretical background.
- **Cite:** statistics showing the importance of the problem
- **Cite:** prior findings that motivate your research question
- **Cite:** theories or frameworks you're building on

### Literature Review
Cite extensively - you're reporting what others found.
- **Cite:** every finding, theory, or method you discuss from another author
- **No citation:** your synthesis or identification of gaps

### Methodology
Cite sparingly - only for established methods.
- **Cite:** validated instruments, scales, or procedures from published sources
- **Cite:** methodological frameworks you're following
- **No citation:** descriptions of YOUR specific procedures

### Results
MINIMAL TO NO CITATIONS - these are YOUR findings.
- **No citation:** your data, statistics, tables, and findings
- **Rare citation:** only if directly comparing your result to a specific prior finding

### Discussion
Moderate citations - interpreting YOUR results in context.
- **Cite:** when comparing your findings to prior work
- **Cite:** theories that help explain your results
- **No citation:** your interpretations, implications, and conclusions

### Limitations/Conclusion
Minimal citations.
- **Cite:** only if referencing specific methodological literature
- **No citation:** your own assessment of limitations and contributions

## Language Guidelines

### Appropriate Language:
- "Our findings indicate..." / "The results show..."
- "We found that [variable] was significantly related to [variable] (β = [value], p [value])"
- "Hypothesis 1 was supported: [your specific finding]..."
- "Our data suggest..."

⚠️ Replace bracketed placeholders with YOUR actual findings and statistics.

### Inappropriate Language (Literature Review Style):
- "Studies have shown..." / "Research indicates..."
- "According to Smith (2020)..."
- "The literature suggests..."
- "Scholars have found..."

## Quality Criteria Requirements

The profile's qualityCriteria MUST include:
1. "Clear hypothesis or research question formulation"
2. "Rigorous empirical methodology with defined sample and variables"
3. "Original data presentation with statistical evidence including tables"
4. "Specific statistical results (β coefficients, p-values, confidence intervals)"
5. "Interpretation of findings in theoretical context"

## Synthesis and Critical Evaluation in Literature Review Section

Even though the Literature Review is a smaller section in research articles, it MUST still demonstrate:

### Synthesis (Not Just Summary)

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:

❌ **AVOID (Descriptive listing):**
> "[Author A] found X. [Author B] found Y. [Author C] found Z."

✅ **USE (Integrated synthesis) - STRUCTURE ONLY:**
> "Prior research converges on the importance of [topic from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id1] [CITE: your-actual-id2], though 
> findings regarding [aspect from YOUR evidence] remain mixed. While [some studies from YOUR evidence] suggest positive effects 
> [CITE: your-actual-id3] [CITE: your-actual-id4], [other studies from YOUR evidence] has yielded conflicting results [CITE: your-actual-id5], 
> potentially due to [explanation you identify]."

⚠️ Replace ALL bracketed content with ACTUAL information from your evidence snippets.

### Critical Evaluation

For key prior studies you're building on, briefly evaluate:
- Methodological strengths and limitations
- Generalizability of findings
- How your study addresses gaps or extends prior work

### Source Diversity

Even in a brief literature review:
- Cite **at least 50%** of available relevant sources
- Don't over-rely on 1-2 papers for all claims
- Use different sources for different aspects of your theoretical framework

## Table Requirements for Research Articles

### Required Tables:

⚠️ TABLE FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES ⚠️
Use YOUR actual data or data from YOUR evidence sources.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics**
| Variable | N | Mean | SD | Min | Max |
|----------|---|------|-----|-----|-----|
| [Your variable] | [Your N] | [Your mean] | [Your SD] | [Your min] | [Your max] |

**Table 2: Correlation Matrix** (if applicable)
|          | Var 1 | Var 2 | Var 3 |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Var 1    | 1.00  |       |       |
| Var 2    | [Your r]* | 1.00  |       |
| Var 3    | [Your r]* | [Your r]* | 1.00  |

**Table 3: Regression/Analysis Results**
| Predictor | β | SE | t | p | 95% CI |
|-----------|-----|------|------|-------|--------------|
| [Your predictor] | [Your β] | [Your SE] | [Your t] | [Your p] | [Your CI] |

### Optional Tables (when appropriate):

**Comparison with Prior Studies:**
⚠️ Only include studies from YOUR evidence - do not invent author names or findings.

| Study | Sample | Method | Key Finding | Our Finding |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [Author from evidence] [CITE: actual-id] | [Sample IF in evidence] | [Method from evidence] | [Finding from evidence] | [Your comparison] |

### Table Guidelines:
- Every results section should have at least ONE data table
- Tables should be referenced in the text ("As shown in Table 1...")
- Include notes explaining significance levels (* p < .05, ** p < .01)
- Don't duplicate table content extensively in prose

---

## Discussion Section: Comparing with Literature

The Discussion section requires careful integration of YOUR findings with prior research:

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:
Use YOUR actual findings and citations from YOUR evidence.

### Pattern 1: Consistent Findings
> "Our finding that [your variable] significantly predicted [your variable] (β = [your value], p [your value]) aligns with 
> prior research [CITE: your-actual-id1] [CITE: your-actual-id2]. This consistency across different samples 
> and methodologies strengthens confidence in this relationship."

### Pattern 2: Divergent Findings
> "Contrary to [Author from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id], we did not find a significant 
> relationship between [variables] (β = [your value], p = [your value]). This discrepancy may reflect 
> differences in [your explanation]."

### Pattern 3: Extending Prior Work
> "Our results extend [Author from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id] by demonstrating that [your finding], 
> a [aspect] not examined in prior research."

⚠️ CRITICAL: Use YOUR actual statistics and cite authors that ARE in your evidence.
Do not copy "Smith et al." or "Jones (2019)" from these examples.

### Critical Comparison Requirements:
- Compare your findings to AT LEAST 3-5 prior studies
- Explain agreements AND disagreements
- Offer explanations for any contradictions
- Connect back to theoretical framework from literature review
