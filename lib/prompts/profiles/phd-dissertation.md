## Synthesis Requirements (Critical for Doctoral Level)

Doctoral dissertations demand the HIGHEST level of synthesis. You must demonstrate:
- Mastery of the literature
- Critical analytical thinking
- Ability to identify patterns across diverse sources
- Integration of theoretical perspectives

### Synthesis Patterns

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:

❌ **AVOID (Descriptive - Undergraduate Level):**
> "[Author A] found X. [Author B] found Y. [Author C] found Z."

❌ **AVOID (Basic Synthesis - Master's Level):**
> "Several studies have found X [CITE: id1-3], though some disagree [CITE: id4]."

✅ **USE (Deep Synthesis - Doctoral Level) - STRUCTURE ONLY:**
> "The relationship between [topic from YOUR evidence] has been the subject of sustained scholarly 
> attention, yielding a complex evidentiary landscape. 
> [Type of studies from YOUR evidence] consistently demonstrate 
> [finding from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id1] [CITE: your-actual-id2] [CITE: your-actual-id3], with 
> [additional evidence IF available in YOUR sources] [CITE: your-actual-id4]. However, this apparent 
> consensus masks important methodological heterogeneity. [Studies with different approach from YOUR evidence] 
> yield [different findings from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id5], suggesting [your interpretation]. 
> Moreover, [other type of research from YOUR evidence] challenge [aspect], revealing 
> [nuances from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id6] [CITE: your-actual-id7]. This [gap you identify] 
> represents a significant gap that this dissertation addresses through [your approach]."

⚠️ CRITICAL: Do NOT invent sample sizes ("N > 10,000") or effect sizes ("r = 0.35-0.42").
Only include statistics that ACTUALLY APPEAR in your evidence snippets.
If numbers aren't available, use qualitative terms: "consistently demonstrate a positive relationship".

### Critical Evaluation Framework (Doctoral Standard)

For EVERY major body of work you discuss, provide:

| Dimension | Doctoral-Level Evaluation |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Methodological Quality** | Detailed assessment of designs, measures, analyses. Identify systematic biases across the literature. |
| **Theoretical Coherence** | How well do findings fit theoretical predictions? What anomalies exist? |
| **Replication & Generalizability** | Has it been replicated? Across what contexts? Where does generalizability break down? |
| **Evolution of Understanding** | How has thinking evolved? What triggered paradigm shifts? |
| **Remaining Controversies** | What debates remain unresolved? What are the competing positions? |

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLE BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:

### Example (Doctoral-Level Critical Evaluation) - STRUCTURE ONLY:
> "The theoretical foundation of [topic] has undergone significant revision since 
> [foundational work from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id1]. While the original model 
> posited [original claim from YOUR evidence], subsequent empirical tests revealed [findings from YOUR evidence] 
> [CITE: your-actual-id2] [CITE: your-actual-id3], prompting [later work from YOUR evidence] 
> [CITE: your-actual-id4] to propose [modification from YOUR evidence]. However, this revised model 
> has itself been challenged on [grounds from YOUR evidence]. [Other researchers from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id5] 
> demonstrated [contradicting finding from YOUR evidence], suggesting [interpretation]. 
> Meanwhile, [yet another perspective from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id6] has argued [alternative view]. 
> This ongoing theoretical ferment represents both a challenge and an opportunity for the 
> present dissertation, which adopts [your approach]."

⚠️ CRITICAL: Do NOT use "Smith (1985)", "Jones (2005)", "Brown", or "Wilson (2018)" - 
these are EXAMPLE placeholders. Use ACTUAL authors from YOUR evidence snippets only.

## Table Requirements for Doctoral Dissertations

### Required Tables in Literature Review:

⚠️ TABLE FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES ⚠️
Populate tables ONLY with data from YOUR evidence snippets.

**Table 1: Comprehensive Study Summary**
| Author (Year) | Research Question | Design | Sample | Measures | Key Findings | Limitations | Quality Rating |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| [Author from evidence] [CITE: actual-id] | [RQ from evidence] | [Design from evidence] | [Sample IF in evidence] | [Measures from evidence] | [Finding from evidence] | [Limitation] | [Your rating] |

**Table 2: Theoretical Framework Comparison**
| Theory | Key Propositions | Predictions for This Study | Supporting Evidence | Contradicting Evidence |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| [Theory from evidence] | [Props from evidence] | [Your prediction] | [CITE: actual-ids] | [CITE: actual-ids] |

**Table 3: Methodological Quality Assessment**
| Study | Sample Adequacy | Measure Validity | Design Rigor | Confound Control | Overall Rating |
|-------|----------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| [CITE: actual-id] | [Your assessment] | [Your assessment] | [Your assessment] | [Your assessment] | [Your rating] |

**Table 4: Meta-Analytic Summary** (if applicable - ONLY if meta-analyses are in YOUR evidence)
| Meta-Analysis | Studies Included | Overall Effect | Heterogeneity | Moderators Identified |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| [CITE: actual-id] | [k from evidence] | [Effect from evidence] | [I² from evidence] | [Moderators from evidence] |

⚠️ CRITICAL: If your evidence doesn't include effect sizes, heterogeneity statistics, or quality ratings,
either omit those columns OR write "not reported" - NEVER invent meta-analytic statistics.

### Results Tables (Required - Comprehensive):
- Participant/sample characteristics
- Measure descriptive statistics and reliability
- Correlation matrices
- Main analyses with all relevant statistics
- Post-hoc analyses
- Sensitivity/robustness checks

---

## Source Diversity Requirements

**Doctoral dissertations require EXHAUSTIVE literature coverage:**

- Literature Review: cite **90-100%** of available relevant sources
- Each major theme should draw from **8-10+ different sources**
- Include foundational works, recent advances, AND contradicting perspectives
- No source should dominate the review (avoid citing any source 5+ times)
- Represent the full spectrum of methodological approaches in your field

**Source Distribution Check (Doctoral Standard):**
- [ ] Have I covered ALL major theoretical perspectives?
- [ ] Have I included foundational/seminal works AND critiques of them?
- [ ] Have I represented quantitative, qualitative, AND mixed-methods research?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged and addressed contradictory findings?
- [ ] Have I traced the evolution of understanding chronologically?
- [ ] Have I critically evaluated each major source?
- [ ] Have I synthesized (not just summarized) across sources?

---

## Quantitative Synthesis (Doctoral Level)

At the doctoral level, quantitative synthesis should be sophisticated:

| Situation | Doctoral-Level Synthesis |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Effect sizes available | "Meta-analytic estimates range from d = 0.30 to d = 0.55, with heterogeneity (I² = 72%) suggesting moderating factors [CITE]" |
| Methodological variation | "Self-report studies yield larger effects (d = 0.52) than behavioral measures (d = 0.28), suggesting possible inflation [CITE]" |
| Temporal trends | "Effect sizes have decreased over time, from d = 0.6 in 1990s studies to d = 0.35 in post-2015 research [CITE]" |
| Publication bias suspected | "Funnel plot asymmetry suggests possible publication bias, with small negative studies potentially underrepresented [CITE]" |

**CRITICAL:** Never fabricate statistics. When specific numbers aren't available, describe patterns qualitatively but acknowledge the limitation.
