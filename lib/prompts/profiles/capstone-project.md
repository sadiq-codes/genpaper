# Capstone Project Context

A capstone project demonstrates your ability to conduct independent research and apply knowledge from your program of study. It should meet rigorous academic standards.

## Structure Expectations

### 1. Introduction (Use Funnel Structure)
- **Start BROAD:** Introduce the general topic and its importance (global/societal level)
- **NARROW DOWN:** Focus on the specific area you're investigating
- **STATE THE PROBLEM:** What gap or issue does your study address?
- **PURPOSE:** Clear statement of what your study aims to accomplish
- **SIGNIFICANCE:** Who benefits from this research and how?
- **SCOPE:** Define the boundaries of your study

### 2. Literature Review (Critical Analysis, Not Just Summary)
- Synthesize existing research to show patterns and themes
- Identify debates, contradictions, and tensions in the literature
- Evaluate methodological strengths and limitations of prior studies
- EXPLICITLY STATE THE GAP your study addresses
- End with justification for why your study is needed

**Organizational Approach - Choose based on your topic:**
- **THEMATIC:** Group by themes (e.g., economic factors, social factors, policy factors)
- **CHRONOLOGICAL:** Show how understanding evolved (e.g., 1990s → 2000s → 2010s → present)
- **METHODOLOGICAL:** Compare quantitative vs. qualitative findings
- **THEORETICAL:** Examine different theoretical explanations

**Pivotal Publications:** Identify and discuss landmark studies that shaped the field. Explain WHY they were influential, not just what they found.

### 3. Methodology (Detailed and Replicable)
- Research design with justification for your choice
- Population and sample (who, how many, how selected)
- Instruments/measures (describe and justify)
- Validity and reliability of instruments
- Data collection procedures (step by step)
- Method of data analysis (statistical tests or qualitative approach)

### 4. Results (Present Without Interpretation)
- Present findings systematically (by research question or hypothesis)
- Use tables and figures appropriately
- Report statistics completely (means, SDs, test statistics, p-values, effect sizes)
- Include a summary of key findings at the end

### 5. Discussion (Three-Part Structure for EACH Finding)

For every major finding, you MUST:
- **STATE:** "Our results showed that..." (what did you find?)
- **COMPARE:** "This aligns with / contradicts Smith (2020) who found..."
- **EXPLAIN:** "This difference may be explained by..." (why agree/disagree?)

Do NOT simply restate results. Connect each finding to existing literature.

### 6. Conclusion
- **Implications:** What do your findings mean for theory and practice?
- **Limitations:** Honest acknowledgment of study constraints
- **Recommendations:** Practical suggestions based on findings
- **Future Research:** What questions remain unanswered?

## Citing Empirical Studies in Literature Review

When reviewing prior research, provide methodological context:

**WEAK:** "Jones (2019) found that motivation affects learning."

**STRONG:** "Jones (2019) surveyed 180 high school students using the Academic Motivation Scale and found that intrinsic motivation significantly predicted test scores (r = .45, p < .01), though the sample was limited to urban schools."

This level of detail shows you understand how methodology affects findings.

## Gap Identification (REQUIRED)

After reviewing literature, explicitly state:
- What has been studied extensively
- What remains understudied or contested
- How YOUR study addresses this gap

**Example:** "Despite extensive research on motivation in university settings, few studies have examined its role in online learning environments. This gap is significant because..."
