# Capstone Project Context

A capstone project demonstrates your ability to conduct independent research and apply knowledge from your program of study. It should meet rigorous academic standards.

## Structure Expectations

### 1. Introduction (Use Funnel Structure)
- **Start BROAD:** Introduce the general topic and its importance (global/societal level)
- **NARROW DOWN:** Focus on the specific area you're investigating
- **STATE THE PROBLEM:** What gap or issue does your study address?
- **PURPOSE:** Clear statement of what your study aims to accomplish
- **SIGNIFICANCE:** Who benefits from this research and how?
- **SCOPE:** Define the boundaries of your study

### 2. Literature Review (Critical Analysis, Not Just Summary)
- Synthesize existing research to show patterns and themes
- Identify debates, contradictions, and tensions in the literature
- Evaluate methodological strengths and limitations of prior studies
- EXPLICITLY STATE THE GAP your study addresses
- End with justification for why your study is needed

**Organizational Approach - Choose based on your topic:**
- **THEMATIC:** Group by themes (e.g., economic factors, social factors, policy factors)
- **CHRONOLOGICAL:** Show how understanding evolved (e.g., 1990s → 2000s → 2010s → present)
- **METHODOLOGICAL:** Compare quantitative vs. qualitative findings
- **THEORETICAL:** Examine different theoretical explanations

**Pivotal Publications:** Identify and discuss landmark studies that shaped the field. Explain WHY they were influential, not just what they found.

### 3. Methodology (Detailed and Replicable)
- Research design with justification for your choice
- Population and sample (who, how many, how selected)
- Instruments/measures (describe and justify)
- Validity and reliability of instruments
- Data collection procedures (step by step)
- Method of data analysis (statistical tests or qualitative approach)

### 4. Results (Present Without Interpretation)
- Present findings systematically (by research question or hypothesis)
- Use tables and figures appropriately
- Report statistics completely (means, SDs, test statistics, p-values, effect sizes)
- Include a summary of key findings at the end

### 5. Discussion (Three-Part Structure for EACH Finding)

For every major finding, you MUST:
- **STATE:** "Our results showed that..." (what did you find?)
- **COMPARE:** "This aligns with / contradicts Smith (2020) who found..."
- **EXPLAIN:** "This difference may be explained by..." (why agree/disagree?)

Do NOT simply restate results. Connect each finding to existing literature.

### 6. Conclusion
- **Implications:** What do your findings mean for theory and practice?
- **Limitations:** Honest acknowledgment of study constraints
- **Recommendations:** Practical suggestions based on findings
- **Future Research:** What questions remain unanswered?

## Citing Empirical Studies in Literature Review

When reviewing prior research, provide methodological context:

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:

**WEAK:** "[Author] found that [topic] affects [outcome]."

**STRONG:** "[Author from YOUR evidence] [method from YOUR evidence] and found that [finding from YOUR evidence] 
([statistic IF in YOUR evidence]), though [limitation from YOUR evidence]."

⚠️ CRITICAL: Only include statistics (r, p-values, sample sizes) that ACTUALLY APPEAR in your evidence.
If numbers aren't available, write qualitatively: "found a significant relationship" instead of inventing "r = .45".

## Gap Identification (REQUIRED)

After reviewing literature, explicitly state:
- What has been studied extensively
- What remains understudied or contested
- How YOUR study addresses this gap

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLE - DO NOT COPY CONTENT:
> "Despite extensive research on [well-studied area from YOUR evidence], few studies have examined 
> [understudied area you identify from YOUR evidence]. This gap is significant because..."

## Synthesis Requirements (Critical for Capstone Level)

A capstone project must demonstrate your ability to SYNTHESIZE, not just summarize.

### Synthesis Patterns

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:

❌ **AVOID (Descriptive - Poor Quality):**
> "[Author A] found X. [Author B] found Y. [Author C] found Z."

✅ **USE (Integrated Synthesis - Expected Quality) - STRUCTURE ONLY:**
> "Research on [topic from YOUR evidence] converges around a central finding: [finding from YOUR evidence] 
> [CITE: your-actual-id1] [CITE: your-actual-id2] [CITE: your-actual-id3]. However, the 
> mechanisms underlying this relationship remain contested. Some [studies from YOUR evidence] 
> attribute it to [factor from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id4], while others emphasize 
> [other factors from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id5]. Notably, [specific studies from YOUR evidence] 
> [CITE: your-actual-id6] suggest [nuance from YOUR evidence], challenging [earlier assumptions from YOUR evidence]."

⚠️ Replace ALL bracketed content with ACTUAL information from your evidence snippets.

### Critical Evaluation Framework

For EACH major finding or claim you discuss, consider:

| Dimension | Questions to Address |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Methodological Quality** | Was the sample adequate? Design appropriate? Measures valid? |
| **Generalizability** | To what contexts do findings apply? Any replication? |
| **Contradictions** | Do other studies disagree? Why might they differ? |
| **Gaps** | What remains untested? What would strengthen the evidence? |

⚠️ FORMAT EXAMPLE BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES, ONLY STRUCTURE:

### Example (Good Critical Evaluation) - STRUCTURE ONLY:
> "While multiple studies support [finding from YOUR evidence] [CITE: your-actual-id1] 
> [CITE: your-actual-id2], methodological limitations warrant caution. [Limitation you identify from YOUR evidence], 
> limiting generalizability. Furthermore, [another limitation from YOUR evidence], as [study from YOUR evidence] 
> [CITE: your-actual-id3] demonstrated [related finding from YOUR evidence]. These limitations highlight 
> the need for [your study's approach]."

⚠️ CRITICAL: Do NOT invent sample sizes ("N=280") or time periods ("4-week," "8+ weeks").
Only include such details if they ACTUALLY APPEAR in your evidence snippets.

## Table Requirements for Capstone Projects

### Required Tables:

⚠️ TABLE FORMAT EXAMPLES BELOW - DO NOT COPY VALUES ⚠️
Populate tables ONLY with data from YOUR evidence snippets.

**Table 1: Summary of Key Studies** (in Literature Review)
| Author (Year) | Sample | Design | Key Finding | Relevance to Present Study |
|---------------|--------|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| [Author from evidence] [CITE: actual-id] | [Sample IF in evidence] | [Design from evidence] | [Finding from evidence] | [Your relevance assessment] |

**Table 2: Comparison of Approaches** (when applicable)
| Approach | Advantages | Limitations | Studies Using |
|----------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| [Method from evidence] | [Advantages from evidence] | [Limitations from evidence] | [CITE: actual-ids] |

⚠️ CRITICAL: If your evidence doesn't include sample sizes or specific advantages/limitations,
write "not reported" - NEVER invent data to fill table cells.

### Results Tables (Required):
- Descriptive statistics for all variables
- Correlation matrix (for quantitative studies)
- Main analysis results with full statistics
- Hypothesis testing summary

### Table Guidelines:
- Every results section should have at least ONE data table
- Literature review should include at least ONE summary table
- Reference tables in the text ("As shown in Table 1...")
- Include notes for significance levels

---

## Source Diversity Requirements

**Capstone projects require THOROUGH literature coverage:**

- Literature Review section: cite **60-80%** of available relevant sources
- Each major theme should draw from **at least 3-4 different sources**
- Avoid citing any single source more than 3 times
- Include both foundational works AND recent research

**Source Distribution Check:**
- [ ] Have I covered the major perspectives on this topic?
- [ ] Am I citing different sources for different claims?
- [ ] Have I included recent research (last 5 years)?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged any contradictory findings?
- [ ] Am I using multiple sources to support key arguments?

---

## Quantitative Synthesis

When multiple studies report similar findings, aggregate when possible:

| Situation | How to Synthesize |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Same metric, 3+ studies | "Effect sizes ranged from r = 0.30 to r = 0.55" |
| Consistent direction | "All four studies found positive effects" |
| Mixed findings | "Results were mixed, with 3 of 6 studies finding significance" |
| No numbers available | "Studies consistently/predominantly/generally found..." |

**CRITICAL:** Never fabricate statistics. If numbers aren't in the evidence, use qualitative synthesis.
