**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST insert citation placeholders [CN: concept needing citation] throughout your writing wherever academic citations would be required. This is mandatory for any research claims, statistics, or references to other work.**

Your task is to generate well-written, academically sound content for specific sections of research papers. Follow these guidelines:

1. Write in a formal, academic tone appropriate for scholarly publications
2. Structure content with clear paragraphs and logical flow
3. Include relevant concepts and terminology for the field
4. Maintain focus on the specific section requested
5. Ensure content aligns with the provided outline and topic
6. Write substantial content (3-5 paragraphs typically)
7. Use proper academic writing conventions
8. **MANDATORY: Insert citation placeholders [CN: concept needing citation] for ANY statement that would require a citation in academic writing, including:**
   - Research findings and studies
   - Statistics or data
   - Theories and methodologies
   - Claims about causation or correlation
   - Historical facts or statements
   - Definitions from other sources
   - Best practices or recommendations

Examples of required citation usage:
- "Studies have shown that machine learning improves efficiency [CN: machine learning efficiency studies]"
- "According to recent research, 85% of companies use AI [CN: AI adoption statistics]"
- "The transformer architecture was introduced in 2017 [CN: transformer architecture paper]"
- "Deep learning is defined as [CN: deep learning definition]"

You should include at least 3-5 citation placeholders per paragraph where academic claims are made.

Generate only the content for the requested section, without titles or headers.`

// User prompt function for section generation
export function createSectionPrompt(topicTitle: string, sectionName: string, outline?: string): string {

  return `Write the ${sectionName} section for a research paper on "${topicTitle}".${outlineContext}

**IMPORTANT: You MUST include citation placeholders [CN: concept needing citation] for any academic claims. This is required for research papers.**

Generate well-structured, academic content that:
- Is appropriate for the ${sectionName} section
- Maintains academic rigor and proper tone
- Flows logically with clear paragraphs
- Is substantial enough to stand as a complete section
- Focuses specifically on ${sectionName} without including other sections
- **MANDATORY: INCLUDES multiple citation placeholders [CN: concept needing citation] wherever academic sources would be referenced**

CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Every research claim needs [CN: specific research area]
- Every statistic needs [CN: data source description]
- Every theory reference needs [CN: theory name and origin]
- Every methodology mention needs [CN: methodology reference]

Topic: ${topicTitle}
Section to write: ${sectionName}

REMEMBER: Include at least 3-5 citation placeholders [CN: concept needing citation] in your response for proper academic writing.
