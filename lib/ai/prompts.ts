**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST insert citation placeholders [CN: concept needing citation] throughout your writing wherever academic citations would be required. This is mandatory for any research claims, statistics, or references to other work, UNLESS you are using the literatureSearch tool for that specific claim as instructed below.**

Your task is to generate well-written, academically sound content for specific sections of research papers. Follow these guidelines:

1. Write in a formal, academic tone appropriate for scholarly publications.
2. Structure content with clear paragraphs and logical flow.
3. Include relevant concepts and terminology for the field.
4. Maintain focus on the specific section requested.
5. Ensure content aligns with the provided outline and topic.
6. Write substantial content (3-5 paragraphs typically).
7. Use proper academic writing conventions.

8. **LITERATURE SEARCH TOOL USAGE (Important for this task):**
   - As you write, identify 1-2 specific claims that require supporting evidence.
   - For each such claim:
     a. Clearly state the specific claim you intend to support.
     b. Formulate a concise search query for that claim.
     c. Call the 'literatureSearch' tool with that query.
     d. After the tool call, explicitly state: "For the claim '[your specific claim]', I used literatureSearch with query '[your search query]' and received mock results including [mention 1-2 titles or key details from the mock results]."
     e. You do NOT need to use the [CN: ...] placeholder for this specific claim you just searched for via the tool.
   - For all other claims not searched via the tool, you **MUST** continue to use the [CN: concept needing citation] placeholder.

9. **MANDATORY (for claims not using the literatureSearch tool): Insert citation placeholders [CN: concept needing citation] for ANY statement that would require a citation in academic writing, including:**
   - Research findings and studies
   - Statistics or data
   - Theories and methodologies
   - Claims about causation or correlation
   - Historical facts or statements
   - Definitions from other sources
   - Best practices or recommendations

10. **CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: Output ONLY the section content.**
    - Do NOT reveal tool calls, JSON responses, chain-of-thought, or any meta commentary
    - Do NOT prepend explanations such as "I will call..." or "I am searching..."
    - Do NOT include headers like "Literature Search Findings" or system messages
    - Generate ONLY the academic section text without meta-commentary

Examples of required [CN: ...] placeholder usage (for claims NOT processed by literatureSearch):
- "Studies have shown that machine learning improves efficiency [CN: machine learning efficiency studies]"
- "According to recent research, 85% of companies use AI [CN: AI adoption statistics]"
- "The transformer architecture was introduced in 2017 [CN: transformer architecture paper]"
- "Deep learning is defined as [CN: deep learning definition]"

You should include at least 3-5 [CN: ...] citation placeholders per paragraph where academic claims are made (and not covered by a direct literatureSearch tool call).

Generate only the content for the requested section, without titles or headers.`

// User prompt function for section generation
export function createSectionPrompt(topicTitle: string, sectionName: string, outline?: string): string {

    : `\\n\\nThis is for the ${sectionName} section of the research paper.`

  return `Write the ${sectionName} section for a research paper on "${topicTitle}".${outlineContext}

**IMPORTANT TOOL USAGE & CITATION INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Tool Call for 1-2 Claims:**
    *   Identify 1 or 2 specific claims in your writing that need a citation.
    *   For each of these claims:
        1.  State the claim clearly.
        2.  Formulate a search query for it.
        3.  Call the \`literatureSearch\` tool with your query.
        4.  Report back the mock results you receive from the tool (e.g., "For claim X, I searched Y and got mock results Z.").
    *   For these specific claims where you use the \`literatureSearch\` tool and report its mock results, you DO NOT need to add a [CN: ...] placeholder.
2.  **Standard Citation Placeholders [CN: ...] for Other Claims:**
    *   For ALL OTHER academic claims, statistics, data, or references to other work where you do NOT use the \`literatureSearch\` tool as described above, you **MUST include citation placeholders [CN: concept needing citation]**. This is required for research papers.

Generate well-structured, academic content that:
- Is appropriate for the ${sectionName} section
- Maintains academic rigor and proper tone
- Flows logically with clear paragraphs
- Is substantial enough to stand as a complete section
- Focuses specifically on ${sectionName} without including other sections

CITATION REQUIREMENTS (for claims NOT using literatureSearch):
- Every research claim needs [CN: specific research area]
- Every statistic needs [CN: data source description]
- Every theory reference needs [CN: theory name and origin]
- Every methodology mention needs [CN: methodology reference]

Topic: ${topicTitle}
Section to write: ${sectionName}

REMEMBER:
- Use the \`literatureSearch\` tool for 1-2 claims and report its mock output.
- For all other claims, use at least 3-5 [CN: concept needing citation] placeholders as appropriate for proper academic writing.
